# Introduction  

### What is Wanchain?  


Wanchain aims to build a blockchain infrastructure that can connect and exchange value between different blockchain networks in a decentralized way. It uses the latest theories of cryptography to make up for the shortcomings of existing inter-chain protocols. Any blockchain network, whether public chain, private chain or alliance chain, can be connected with Wanchain. In addition to supporting smart contracts, Wanchain also has privacy protection. 

### Differentiation from other blockchain projects

The ultimate vision of Wanchain is to create an “Internet” of blockchains. Within Wanchain’s ecosystem, thousands of chains will interconnected, and value can be transferred smoothly without barriers.  

Wanchain uses secure multi-party computation, threshold secret sharing, ring signatures based on elliptic curve cryptography, one time account generation and many other cutting-edge cryptographic technologies. Wanchain boasts a professional cryptography research team who will continue to contribute by actively applingy their expertise to the building of real world blockchain applications.
